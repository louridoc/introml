# Introduction to Machine Learning in Python


**This repo has been cloned and modified for future reference to common machine learning algorithms.

This repository provides instructional material for 
machine learning in python.  The material is used for two classes taught at NYU Tandon
by [Sundeep Rangan](http://wireless.engineering.nyu.edu/sundeep-rangan/):

* EE-UY / CS-UY 4563: Introduction to Machine Learning (Undergraduate)
* EL-GY 6143: Introduction to Machine Learning (Graduate)

## Pre-requisites

* All the software can be run on any laptop (Windows, MAC or UNIX).
[Instructions](./GCP/getting_started.md)
are also provided to run the code in Google Cloud Platform on a virtual machine (VM).
* If you want to avoid setting up software on your local machine,
most of the demos can also be directly run in the cloud on the excellent 
[Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com) cloud service.
* Both the undergrad and graduate classes assume no python or ML experience.  However, experience
with some programming language (preferably object-oriented) is required.
* To follow all the mathematical details and to complete the homework exercises,
the class assumes undergraduate probability, linear algebra and multi-variable calculus.
